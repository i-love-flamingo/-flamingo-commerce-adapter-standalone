# csvcommerce

This module provides:
* a IndexUpdater for "commercesearch" module
* an image controller that shows product images


## Usage for products:

Place a `products.csv`  and the product images in a folder - e.g. "ressources".

The images are served with the imagecontroller under the default route `/image/:size/:filename`
The ":size" parameter is in the form "widthxheight" - for example "200x" would scale the image to a width of 200px and the height is adjusted automatically.
The allowed imagesizes need to be configured (`flamingo-commerce-adapter-standalone.csvCommerce.allowedImageResizeParamaters`)

See the commerce-demo-carotene Demoshop for an example usage.

Categories are only indexed if a category.csv is given.

## Configuration

```
flamingoCommerceAdapterStandalone: 
	csvindexing: 
		productCsvPath: "ressources/products/products.csv"
		categoryCsvPath: "ressources/products/category.csv"
		locale: "en_GB"
		currency: "â‚¬"
		allowedImageResizeParamaters: "200x,300x,400x,x200,x300"
	}
```

 
## CSV Format

Use UTF8 encoded CSV with optional quotes and comma (,) as seperator. 


### Product CSV

The text fields that are normaly localized need to be postfixed with the configured local.
So if you have the configuration `flamingoCommerceAdapterStandalone.csvindexing.locale: en_GB`
a product title fieldname in the CSV need to be `title-en_GB`.

Price fields need to be postfixed with currency name.
Asset and Images paths need to be relative to the CSV folder.

Must have fields:
* marketplaceCode (the unique idendifier of the product)
* title-LOCALEPREFIX (the title)
* productType ("simple" or "configurable")
* price-CURRENCY 

Optional:
* specialPrice-CURRENCY
* categories (comma separated references to categories. Using the category code as idendifier)
* retailerCode (reference to the retailer / vendor of the product)
* shortDescription-LOCALEPREFIX
* description-LOCALEPREFIX
* metaKeywords-LOCALEPREFIX (comma separated keywords)
* listImage
* thumbnailImage
* detailImage01,detailImage02 ... detailImage10
* ??? - any other field will be added as a product attribute

For configurable product types:
* variantVariationAttributes (The attribute)
* CONFIGURABLE-products (comma separated references to other products (use marketplacecode as id))
